<h1>HabitLab</h1>

<p>Build better habits online! Tell HabitLab your goals, and it will determine the appropriate interventions via experimentation.
Spend less time on distracting sites like Facebook and Youtube with various tools like news feed blockers, comment hiders, and more; see which ones work best for you!</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>Tell HabitLab which sites you want to spend less time on. We support most popular sites like Facebook, Youtube, Reddit, Buzzfeed, Netflix, etc - you can also add any site you want.</p>
<p>Each time you visit those sites, we will intelligently choose an intervention (which use techniques such as hiding your news feed, hiding comments, pausing videos) to help you reduce your time on the site. If you don’t like an intervention, you can choose to disable it.
HabitLab learns which interventions work best for you, and uses this to more effectively help you reduce your time online.</p>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>HabitLab is an open-source project developed by the Stanford HCI Group. You can find source code at https://github.com/habitlab/habitlab</p>

<h2>Permissions</h2>

<p>Chrome will ask you for the following permissions when you install. Here’s how we use them:</p>

<p>“Read and Write Data on All Websites”: We need this permission to change the appearance of pages deploy interventions on the sites you choose to reduce your time spent on.</p>
<p>“Show Notifications”: We use notifications to show you a daily progress summary on how you have been achieving your goals.</p>
<p>“Browsing History”: We use your browsing history to determine how much time you’ve spent on sites in the past, so we can measure how much time you’ve been saving.</p>

<h2>Privacy and Data</h2>

<p>You can optionally help us improve HabitLab by sending us anonymized data about the effectiveness of interventions. You can opt-out of sharing any data when you first set up HabitLab. See https://github.com/habitlab/habitlab/wiki/Privacy</p>
